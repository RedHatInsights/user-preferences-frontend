# Welcome to User Preferences Frontend Storybook

Welcome to the **Red Hat Console User Preferences Frontend** component library! This Storybook showcases all the reusable components, design patterns, and documentation for our user preferences and notification management system.

## What is User Preferences Frontend?

The User Preferences Frontend is a React application that provides:

- **Email Preferences** - Configure email notification delivery for console events
- **Notification Preferences** - Manage notification behavior groups and event types
- **User Settings** - Customize your Red Hat Console experience
- **Integrations** - Connect with external notification services

## Architecture Overview

Our application is built with modern React patterns and integrates with the Red Hat Console platform:

### Key Technologies
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Redux** with ReducerRegistry for state management
- **PatternFly 6** for design system and components
- **Data-Driven Forms** for dynamic form rendering
- **React Router 6** for navigation
- **react-intl** for internationalization
- **Storybook** for component development

### Integration Points
- **Red Hat Console Chrome** - Platform integration via `useChrome`
- **Notifications Backend API** - Event and notification management
- **Feature Flags (Unleash)** - Feature toggling via `useFlag`
- **Data-Driven Forms** - Dynamic form schemas for user preferences

## How to Use This Storybook

### Component Stories
Browse through our components organized by category:
- **Components** - Reusable UI components
- **Form Components** - Data-Driven Forms field components
- **Documentation** - Guides and best practices

### Interactive Controls
Most stories include interactive controls that let you:
- Toggle props and see real-time changes
- Test different component states
- Experiment with various data configurations
- Test form behaviors with Data-Driven Forms

### Documentation
Each component includes:
- **Props documentation** - All available properties
- **Usage examples** - Common patterns and implementations
- **Design guidelines** - When and how to use components
- **Form integration** - How to use with Data-Driven Forms

## Context & Environment Testing

Our Storybook includes a context mocking system that allows you to test components with different:

### Environment Contexts
- **Production** - Prod environment behavior
- **Staging** - Stage environment features
- **CI/QA** - Testing environment configurations

### Feature Flags
- Test components with different feature flag combinations
- Validate new features before rollout
- Test legacy behavior alongside new features

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Start Storybook**: `npm run storybook`
3. **Build Storybook**: `npm run build-storybook`

### For Designers
- Browse components in the **Components** section
- Use the **Controls** panel to experiment with different states
- Check the **Docs** tab for detailed usage guidelines

## Contributing

### Adding New Stories
When creating new components, always include:
- Comprehensive prop documentation
- Multiple usage examples
- Different state variations
- Accessibility considerations
- Data-Driven Forms integration examples (for form components)

### Story File Naming
- Place stories next to their component: `Component.stories.tsx`
- Use descriptive story names that explain the variant

### Documentation Standards
- Use descriptive story names
- Include context about when to use components
- Document any special behaviors or limitations
- Show how to integrate with Data-Driven Forms

## Design Principles

### Consistency
- Follow PatternFly design guidelines
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Maintain design token usage

### Accessibility
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Test with screen readers
- Provide keyboard navigation

### Form Best Practices
- Use Data-Driven Forms for dynamic form fields
- Follow component mapper patterns
- Provide clear validation messages
- Support both controlled and uncontrolled forms
